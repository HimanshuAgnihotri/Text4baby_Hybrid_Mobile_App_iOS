                	<h2>No TV for Baby</h2>
                    <p>Pediatricians recommend that babies under the age of 2 don't watch TV. Parents are often surprised by this! Surveys tell us that about 40% of babies are watching some sort of video by age 5 months, and by age 2 the number rises to 90%.</p>
                    <h5>Early Brain Development</h5>
                    <p>Kids' brains grow a huge amount during the first 3 years of life. Your baby's brain grows 3 times its size in the first year alone. During this time your baby's Dr. wants to make sure that your baby is learning from the real world because it helps your baby's brain grow more.</p>
                    <p>Here is an example, think about a ball in real life and a ball on TV. Infants are developing 3-dimensional vision. On TV it is 2 dimensions, so the ball is just a flat, shaded circle. If you roll a ball across the floor it moves in a single motion, slowing gradually until it stops. The same action on TV is broken up. You see the ball leave someone's hand, then there's a shot of it in motion, then a picture of the ball at rest. If your infant wants to grab a ball in real life he'll move for it, grab it, or crawl after it. The stuff on the screen just disappears, to be replaced by other stuff; you can never get your hands (or mouth) on it. Infants may stare at the bright colors and motion on a screen, but their brains don't know what it means. <strong>It takes 2 full years for a baby's brain to develop to the point where they know what they are seeing on the TV is also what exists in real life.</strong></p>
                    <p>Doctors also say there is good research and evidence that shows TV watching before age 2 has lasting negative effects on children's language development, reading skills, and short term memory. It also contributes to problems with sleep and attention.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes TV seems like an easy way to entertain your child if you have to get something done, but find a friend, toy, stationary activity center, or room with no dangerous objects and just let your baby move instead-you are doing great things for her brain development!</p>

                	<h2>Crying Baby</h2>
                    <p>All babies cry and some cry more than others. It's important to respond quickly when your baby cries during the first few months of life. Don't worry about spoiling your newborn baby. If you respond quickly to your baby's cries, she may cry less overall.</p>
                    <p>If your baby cries often, it doesn't mean you're a bad parent. It can be very frustrating, as you get to know your baby, you'll learn how much crying is normal for her and what you can do to help.</p>

                                <p>Whether you choose to brush your child's teeth (or gums) right after the last feeding or just before the actual bedtime itself, we strongly encourage you to get in the habit of having a toothbrush (or washcloth or gauze) be the last thing in your baby's mouth at night.</p>

                                <p>Since you don't want food or drink to become your child's bedtime source of comfort, books can serve as the perfect reminder that it's time to cuddle up and go to sleep.</p>

                	<h2>Vaccines</h2>
                    <p>Vaccines prevent dangerous or even deadly diseases. Vaccines reduce the risk of infection by working with the body's to help it safely develop immunity to the diseases.</p>
                    <p>When germs, such as bacteria or viruses, come into the body, they attack and grown in number. This invasion of germs is called an infection, and the infection is what causes illness. The immune system then has to fight the infection. Once the immune system fights off the infection, the body is left with a supply of cells that help recognize and fight that disease in the future.</p>
                    <p>Vaccines help develop immunity by pretending to be an infection, but this "imitation" infection does not cause illness. It does, however, cause the immune system to develop the same response as it does to a real infection so the body can recognize and fight the vaccine-preventable disease in the future.</p>
                    <p>The side effects associated with getting vaccines are almost always mild (such as redness and swelling where the shot was given) and go away within a few days. If your child experiences a reaction at the injection site, you can use a cool, wet cloth to reduce redness, soreness, and swelling.</p>
                    <p>Serious side effects following vaccination, such as severe allergic reaction, are very rare and doctors and clinic staff are trained to deal with them. Pay extra attention to your child for a few days after vaccination. If you see something that concerns you, call your child's doctor.</p>

                    <p>Try to keep babies younger than 6 months out of direct sunlight. Find shade under a tree, umbrella, or a stroller. If protective clothing and shade are not available, use sunscreen on small areas of the body, such as the face and the backs of the hands.</p>

                    <p>You can apply sunscreen to all areas of the body, but be careful around the eyes. If your baby rubs sunscreen into her eyes, wipe the eyes and hands clean with a damp cloth. If a rash develops, talk with your child's doctor.</p>

                	<h2>Car Seat Safety</h2>
                    <p>One of your first important jobs as a parent is making sure your baby is safe in any vehicle she rides in.</p>
                    <div class="topics-list-grid">
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>
                                <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all infants should ride rear-facing starting with their <strong>first ride home from the hospital</strong>.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>For the best possible protection, <strong>keep your baby in a rear-facing child safety seat in a back seat for as long as possible</strong> - up to the height or weight limit of the particular seat. All infants and toddlers should ride in a rear-facing car seat until they are 2 years of age or until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car seat's manufacturer. You may have heard parents with older kids talk about a "12 months and 20 pounds" rule to turn their child forward-facing in the car but this is actually the minimum size and age requirement for that change. As the AAP says, you should keep a baby rear-facing in a convertible seat until he or she reaches the highest height or weight allowed by the manufacturer. For many children that will be 30, 35 or even 40 pounds. <strong>Many kids will be over age 2 when they reach that weight</strong>. Rear-facing children are safest.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Use your baby's car seat rear-facing and semi-reclined to no more than 45 degrees, so the baby's head stays in contact with the seat and the baby's airway stays open. Read the car seat instructions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Make sure the buckled straps that keep your baby fit in the car seat are snug. Loose straps don't provide the most protection. Be sure the harness is tight enough that you cannot pinch the strap at the shoulder.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Position the shoulder straps through the slots at or below your baby's shoulders.</p>

                            <li>
                                <p>Adjust the chest clip to armpit level.</p>

                                <p>Use either the car's seat belt or lower anchors and tethers for children (LATCH) system to lock the car seat into the car. Do not use both systems at the same time.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Your car seat should not move more than one inch side to side or front to back. To test it, grab the car seat at the safety belt or LATCH path.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Every car seat has an expiration date. Generally, it is six years from manufacture date. Many have the expiration date stamped on the seat. Contact the manufacturer of your specific seat to find out what its expiration date is.</p>

                                <p>Never buy a used car seat if you do not know its full history. Never use a car seat that has been in a crash. Avoid seats sold at flea markets or yard sales or online.</p>

                            <li>
                                <p>Do not use any products that did not come from the manufacturer in or with the car seat. Car seat fabrics meet strict fire safety codes.</p>

                                <p>Find the frontal airbags in your vehicle by checking the owner's manual. Never put a rear-facing car seat in front of an active frontal airbag. Children are always safest in a back seat.</p>

                	<h2>Baby Walkers</h2>
                    <p>Many parents think walkers will help their children learn to walk. But they don't. In fact, walkers can actually delay when a child starts to walk.</p>
                    <h5>Babies in Walkers Can Get Many Injuries</h5>
                    <div class="topics-list-grid">
                    	<ul>

                                <p>Roll down the stairs - which often causes broken bones and severe head injuries. This is how most children get hurt in baby walkers.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Get burned - a child can reach higher in a walker. It is now easier for a child to pull a tablecloth off a table and spill hot coffee, grab pot handles off the stove, and reach radiators, fireplaces, or space heaters.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Drown - a child can fall into a pool or bathtub while in a walker.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Be poisoned - reaching high objects is easier in a walker.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Most walker injuries happen while adults are watching. Parents or caregivers simply cannot get there fast enough. A child in a walker can move more than 3 feet in 1 second! That is why walkers are never safe to use, even with an adult close by.</p>

                                    	<p>Play yards or playpens-these are great safety zones for children as they learn to sit, crawl, or walk.</p>

                    <h5>Teething Tips for Your Baby</h5>
                    <p>When babies are teething, they may become fussy, sleepless and irritable, lose their appetite or drool more than usual. <strong>Diarrhea, rashes and a fever are not normal for a teething baby</strong>. If your baby has a fever or diarrhea while teething or continues to be cranky and uncomfortable, call your doctor.</p>
                    <p>Babies may get sore or tender gums when their teeth cut their gums. Gently rubbing your child's gums with a clean finger, a small, cool spoon or a wet gauze pad can soothe them. A clean cold or frozen teething ring may also help.</p>
                    <p>When baby teeth break through the gums, brush the teeth with a soft-bristled toothbrush and a little water to prevent tooth decay. Fluoride toothpaste is not recommended until a child reaches age 2.</p>
                    <p>Begin regular dental checkups no later than your child's first birthday.</p>

                	<h2>Cavities</h2>
                    <p>Your child's baby teeth are at risk for decay (cavities) as soon as they show up - usually around age 6 months. Tooth decay in infants and toddlers usually occurs in the upper front teeth, but it can also occur in other teeth. In some cases, infants and toddlers have experienced decay so severe that the teeth cannot be saved and need to be removed. The good news - decay is mostly preventable.</p>
                    <h5>Causes of Decay</h5>
                    <p>Tooth decay begins when cavity-causing bacteria is passed to an infant. For example, if you put your baby's spoon or pacifier in your mouth and then put it in your baby's mouth, cavity-causing bacteria is passed to the baby.</p>
                    <p>Another cause of tooth decay in babies is if you give your baby liquids that contain sugar, like fruit juice or soda and let her have them a lot or drink them for a long time.</p>
                    <p>It's also important to put your baby to bed WITHOUT a bottle. Sugary liquids from a bottle pool around the teeth while the child sleeps. Bacteria in the mouth use these sugars as food. They then produce acids that attack the teeth. Each time your child drinks these liquids, acids attack for 20 minutes or longer. After these attacks, the teeth can decay.</p>
                    <p>Pacifiers dipped in sugar, honey or sweetened liquids can also lead to tooth decay since the sugar or honey can provide food for the bacteria's acid attacks.</p>

                    <p>Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It is caused by a build-up in the blood of a yellow pigment called bilirubin. Jaundice occurs in over 50 percent of all newborns. Skin usually starts to turn yellow a few days after birth. If you think your baby has a yellowish color, call your baby's health care provider.</p>
                    <p>Most babies with jaundice are alert and eat and sleep normally. However, you should call the baby's health care provider immediately or seek emergency medical care if a baby with jaundice:</p>

                    <p>Most babies with jaundice do not need treatment. Health care providers sometimes suggest steps parents can take at home to help clear up mild to moderate jaundice. Your baby's provider may recommend increasing the number of feedings to encourage more bowel movements, which helps eliminate bilirubin.</p>
                    <p>If a baby has moderate to severe jaundice that does not clear up on its own, treatment is recommended:</p>

                                <p><strong>Phototherapy</strong>: The baby, wearing only a small diaper, is placed under special white or blue lights called bili-lights. Some babies receive phototherapy before discharge from the newborn nursery or are admitted to the hospital for a few days for phototherapy, while others are treated at home.</p>

                                <p><strong>Exchange transfusions</strong>: Babies who do not respond to phototherapy and continue to have rising or dangerously high bilirubin levels may need to be treated with a special kind of blood transfusion.</p>

                	<h2>Preemies Correct Age</h2>
                    <p>Developmental milestones are things most children can do by a certain age. When your baby is born early (premature) you need to know both your baby's due date and how many weeks premature your baby was to determine your baby's corrected age. Your baby's corrected age should be used to track her developmental milestones.</p>
                    <h5>To calculate your baby's corrected age:</h5>
                    <div class="topics-list-grid">
                    	<ul>
                        	<li>
                                <p>Begin with your baby's age in weeks (number of weeks since he was born)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Subtract the number of weeks old your baby was at birth from 40. This is the number of weeks your baby was premature.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Subtract the number of weeks your baby was premature from your baby's age in weeks. A full term pregnancy is 40 weeks. This is your baby's corrected age:</p>
                                <ul>
                                	<li>
                                    	<p>(Baby's current age in weeks) - (Number of weeks premature your baby was) = Baby's corrected age</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                    	<p>Example, Andrew is now 6 months old (24 weeks since birth). Andrew was born at 28 weeks. So he was 12 weeks premature (40 weeks - 28 weeks). Andrew's corrected age is 24 weeks - 12 weeks = 12 weeks (3 months).</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h5>What to Expect: Corrected Age</h5>
                    <p>For Andrew even though he is 6 months old his parents should expect him to act and meet the developmental milestones of a 3 month old.</p>
                    <p>For example, people may think Andrew is delayed for a 6-month old, when in fact he is actually doing great and meeting milestones ahead of his corrected age of 3 months.</p>

                    <p>At 1 year of age, the typical child weighs about 3 times their birth weight. Breastfed babies tend to be chubbier than formula-fed babies during the first 4 to 6 months of life. Then breastfed babies usually become leaner than formula-fed babies by 9 months to 1 year of age.</p>
                    <p>If your baby always seems hungry or doesn't have the appetite that you think they should, talk to your baby's doctor.</p>

                    <p>Here are some questions to consider before starting baby on solid foods:</p>

                                <p><strong>Is baby big enough?</strong> Generally, when infants double their birth weight (typically at about 4 months) and weigh about 13 pounds or more, they may be ready for solid foods. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for about 6 months.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Can he hold his head up?</strong> Your baby should be able to sit in a high chair or infant seat with good head control.</p>

                                <p><strong>Does she open her mouth when food comes her way?</strong> Babies may be ready if they watch you eating, and want to try and eat your food.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Can he move food from a spoon into his throat?</strong> If you offer a spoon of rice cereal and he pushes it out of his mouth and it dribbles onto his chin, he may not have the ability to move it to the back of his mouth to swallow it. It's normal. Remember, he's never had anything thicker than breast milk or formula before, and this may take some getting used to. You can make it thinner by adding water and may also want to wait a week or two and try again.</p>

                    <p>When you add solid foods to your baby's diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You can continue to breastfeed after 12 months if you and your baby desire.</p>
                    <p>Check with your child's doctor about your baby needing vitamin D and iron supplements during the first year.</p>

Whichever type of cereal you use, make sure that it is made for babies and iron-fortified. Many pediatricians will recommend starting vegetables before fruits. If your baby has been mostly breastfeeding, you may want to start with meat, which contains more easily absorbed sources of iron and zinc that are needed by 4 to 6 months of age. Check with your child's doctor.</p>
                    <h5>How do I feed my baby?</h5>
                    <p>Start with half a spoonful or less and talk to your baby through the process ('Mmm, see how good this is?'). Your baby may not know what to do at first. She may look confused, wrinkle her nose, roll the food around her mouth, or reject it altogether. One way to make eating solids for the first time easier is to give your baby a little breast milk and/or formula first, then switch to very small half-spoonfuls of food, and finish with more breast milk and/or formula. This will prevent your baby from getting frustrated when she is very hungry.</p>
                    <p class="italic">NOTE: Do not put baby cereal in a bottle because your baby could choke. It also may increase the amount of food your baby eats and can cause your baby to gain too much weight. However, cereal in a bottle may be recommended if your baby has reflux. Check with your child's doctor.</p>
                    <h5>When can my baby try other food?</h5>
                    <p>Once your baby learns to eat one food, gradually give him other foods. Give your baby one new food at a time, and wait at least 2 to 3 days before starting another. After each new food, watch for any allergic reactions such as diarrhea, rash, or vomiting. If any of these occur, stop using the new food and consult with your child's doctor.</p>
                    <p>Within a few months of starting solid foods, your baby's daily diet should include a variety of foods each day that may include the following:</p>

                    <p>At your first prenatal visit, your provider will calculate your due date, schedule blood tests, may perform a pelvic and breast exam, measure your height and weight, listen to your heart and lungs, and touch and push lightly on your stomach.

                	<h2>Ultrasound</h2>
                	<p>Ultrasound (also called sonogram) is a prenatal test that uses sound waves to show a picture of your baby in your uterus. It lets your provider check on your baby's health and development.</p>
                    <p>Ultrasound can be a fun time in pregnancy because you can "see" your baby! Depending on when it's done and your baby, you may be able to see his hands, legs and other body parts. You may be able to tell if your baby's a boy or a girl, so be sure to tell your provider if you don't want to know!</p>
                    <p>Most women get an ultrasound at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy. You may get a first-trimester ultrasound (called an early ultrasound) to make sure you're pregnant and find out your due date.</p>
                    <p>Why do I need an ultrasound? Your health care provider uses ultrasound to check your baby's growth and development and to help estimate your baby's due date. Ultrasound checks for several things, including:</p>

                    <p>Ultrasound is safe for you and your baby when done by your health care provider. Because ultrasound uses sound waves instead of radiation, it's safer than X-rays. Providers have used ultrasound for more than 30 years, and they have not found any dangerous risks.</p>

                    <h5>Tdap Vaccine</h5>
                	<p>Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is an infectious disease that begins like a cold. Someone with pertussis usually has a runny nose and cough. As the cough gets worse it can last up to six weeks or more. Often parents don't realize they are carrying the disease, so they unknowingly pass it on to their infant. Most babies who get pertussis get it from a family member who has it. Pertussis can be deadly to infants. It keeps them from breathing and eating, and may cause pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and even death. The best way to prevent pertussis is to get vaccinated with either the Tdap (for older children and adults) or DTaP (for infants and children) vaccines.</p>

                	<h2>Tests</h2>
                	<p>A number of tests are suggested for all mothers during prenatal care. Some of these tests are done with samples of blood, urine, or cells from your cervix and vagina. You will also be tested for infections such as sexually transmitted diseases. The results of these tests are used to check for potential problems for you and your baby. If something is found, many problems can be treated during pregnancy.</p>

                	<h2>Prenatal Vitamins</h2>
                	<p>While you are pregnant you need additional vitamins and minerals to support yourself and baby. Even if you regularly eat a varied, healthy diet, you need to take a prenatal vitamin every day.</p>
                    <p>Folic acid is the synthetic form of the B vitamin folate, which is found in leafy greens and other foods. Many prenatal vitaminss have as much as 800 micrograms of folic acid, which is safe and helps prevent birth defects. Talk to your healthcare provider if you've had a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect as you may need more folic acid than found in most prenatal vitamins.</p>
                    <h5>Find a Vitamin Just Right for You</h5>
                	<p>Does your throat close at the thought of swallowing a capsule? Look for a chewable, liquid or even gummy prenatal vitamin. Many pregnant women take the vitamin B6, particularly during the first trimester, to help with nausea and morning sickness. Most experts advise 50 milligrams of B6 daily if you're dealing with morning sickness. You may find a prenatal vitamin that includes this in your daily dose and then you can skip the extra supplements.</p>
                    <p>If you're prone to iron deficiencies, look for a higher level of iron in the prenatal vitamin you choose, but be aware that iron supplements can cause stomach upset and constipation.</p>
                    <p>Many makers of prenatal vitamins are now including omega-3 fatty acids in the form of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). This healthy fat has been shown to promote brain and eye development in the fetus and experts are currently exploring other ways that essential fatty acids benefit both you and your baby during pregnancy.</p>

                	<h2>Folic Acid</h2>
                	<p>Take a prenatal vitamin each day that has 600 micrograms of folic acid in it. This may help reduce baby's risk for birth defects of the brain and spine called neural tube defects (NTDs). The neural tube is the part of a developing baby that becomes the brain and spinal cord. Your health care provider can prescribe a prenatal vitamin for you. You can also get prenatal vitamins over the counter without a prescription.</p>

                	<h2>Eating Seafood</h2>
                	<p>The nutritional value of seafood is particularly important for pregnant or breastfeeding mothers. Seafood can be part of a healthy diet for pregnant and breastfeeding women Seafood provides important nutrients, including omega-3 fats that are good for your health and your baby's health. Omega-3 fats from seafood are healthy fats shown to improve the development of the nervous system of an unborn child or young baby.</p>
                    <p>Eat at least 8 and up to 12 ounces of cooked seafood each week. Seafood choices that are higher in omega-3s include salmon, herring, mussels, trout, sardines, and pollock.</p>
                    <h5>Mercury in Seafood</h5>
                    <p>Seafood may contain unhealthy chemicals, like mercury. Mercury can harm the developing nervous system in an unborn child or young baby. Seafood has varying levels of mercury. Choose fish lower in mercury to get the health benefits of seafood with the least risk. Choices that are lower in mercury include salmon, flounder, tilapia, trout, pollock, and catfish. You should NOT eat fish high in mercury like shark, swordfish, tilefish, and King mackerel. Canned "white" tuna (albacore) is higher in mercury than the "light" variety; limit canned white tuna to less than 6 ounces per week.</p>
                    <h5>Seafood From Local Waters</h5>
                    <p>In addition to mercury, fish may contain other harmful chemicals, including fish caught in local waters. Check local advisories to learn about the safety of fish caught in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. Advisories may recommend that people limit or avoid eating some types fish caught in certain places. If no advice is available, you may eat up to 1 meal (6 ounces) per week of fish from local waters, but don't eat any other fish during that week.</p>

                    <p>High blood pressure that a mother has had before pregnancy is called chronic hypertension and needs to be controlled because it can lead to health problems such as heart failure or stroke. During pregnancy chronic hypertension may affect the growth of your baby. If you take medication to control your blood pressure, your health care provider will determine whether it is safe to use during pregnancy.</p>
                    <h5>High Blood Pressure a Mother First Gets During the Second Half of Pregnancy</h5>
                    <p>When high blood pressure first occurs during the second half of pregnancy it is known as gestational hypertension. This type of high blood pressure goes away soon after the baby is born. You may need to see your health care provider more often to have your blood pressure checked.</p>

                	<p>Preeclampsia is a serious medical condition affecting all organs of the body. Preeclampsia is gestational hypertension (high blood pressure) with additional findings. For example, preeclampsia causes stress on the kidneys, which results in increased amounts of protein in the woman's urine. Other signs of preeclampsia may include:</p>

                    <p>If preeclampsia develops, the only real cure is to have the baby. A mother with preeclampsia may need to stay in the hospital so that she and her baby can be monitored. In some cases the baby may be delivered early. The decision to deliver the baby depends on the risks to the woman and the baby. When preeclampsia becomes severe, the woman's organs can be damaged, including the kidneys, liver, brain, heart, and eyes. In some cases, seizures will occur. This is called eclampsia.</p>

                	<h2>Gestational Diabetes</h2>
                	<p>Gestational diabetes develops in women for the first time during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is caused by a change in the way the mother's body responds to insulin during pregnancy.</p>
                    <p>Insulin is a hormone. It moves glucose out of the blood and into the body's cells where it can be turned into energy. During pregnancy a woman's cells naturally become slightly more resistant to insulin's effects. This change is designed to increase the mother's blood glucose level to make more nutrients available to the baby. The mother's body makes more insulin to keep the blood glucose level normal.</p>
                    <p>In a small number of women, even this increase is not enough to keep their blood glucose levels in the normal range. As a result, they develop gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes increases the risk of having a very large baby and possible cesarean delivery. High blood pressure and preeclampsia are more common as well. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes may have problems with breathing, low glucose levels and jaundice. With proper prenatal care and careful control of glucose levels, the risk of these problems decreases.</p>
                    <p>If you have gestational diabetes you will need to keep your blood glucose level under control. Controlling your blood glucose level may require daily tracking of your glucose level, eating healthy foods, exercising regularly and sometimes taking medications.</p>
                    <p>For most women, gestational diabetes goes away after childbirth. However, they remain at high risk of having diabetes later in life. For women who had mild diabetes before pregnancy, it is a lifelong condition. Mothers with gestational diabetes will need to have regular diabetes testing after pregnancy (6-12 weeks after birth)-if the result is normal than you need to be tested for diabetes every 3 years.</p>

                	<h2>Morning Sickness</h2>
                	<p>If you're going to experience it, morning sickness usually begins not long after you first become pregnant and lasts until the end of the first trimester. Morning sickness can occur at any time of the day. It can be mild or severe and includes everything from feeling nauseated to severe daily vomiting. It can be annoying, but it shouldn't interfere with your everyday activities.</p>
                    <h5>Getting a Break</h5>
                    <p>For most pregnant women, morning sickness gets better by the 12th week of pregnancy. For others, a break doesn't come until around the 20th week, and a very small percentage of women experience it throughout pregnancy. While you definitely don't enjoy it, morning sickness is actually considered a good sign of a healthy pregnancy as it's triggered by the rising levels of the pregnancy hormone hCG.</p>

                    <p>If none of these things work and you're losing weight, vomiting more than once or twice a day, or the vomiting is interfering with your normal daily activities, your healthcare provider may be able to prescribe anti-nausea medications for you.</p>

                	<h2>Bleeding</h2>
                	<p>One of the scariest things that can happen to you when you are pregnant is to notice some vaginal bleeding or "spotting." Fortunately, not all bleeding and spotting means that something is wrong; but it is important to know what to do if it happens.</p>
                    <p>Spotting is typically a small amount of often blood-tinged mucous that you only see when you wipe with tissue after going to the bathroom or you may see a few spots on your underwear. The earliest spotting that you may experience can actually be a sign that the embryo is implanting into the wall of the uterus. Known as implantation bleeding, this often occurs about 2 weeks after you have missed your period. This spotting is very short-lived and should not continue, or get heavier.</p>
                    <p>Another kind of spotting can happen after you have sex. During your pregnancy the hormones that are keeping the pregnancy moving along also make the cervix very soft. The blood vessels in the cervix become engorged and can bleed easily. So after a romantic night with your partner you may notice a little pink or brown, mucous-like spotting up to 12 hours after the event. This is one of the most common reasons that moms call their practitioners in early pregnancy; but this can occur at any point. If you go to the hospital or call the office to tell them you have some spotting, don't think they are being nosey for asking you when was the last time you had sex!</p>
                    <p>Obviously, sometimes bleeding in early pregnancy could be a sign that you might be starting to miscarry the pregnancy. This type of bleeding is bright red and heavier, more like the start of your period or your period itself. A persistent dark brown discharge may also be a sign that something is going on. Any bleeding that is also accompanied by cramping needs further evaluation and you should call your doctor or certified nurse midwife.</p>

                                <p>Avoid exercises with any risk of falling on your abdomen or pelvic region: such as skiing, horseback riding, bicycling, and jumping, such as into a pool</p>

                                <p>And skip the tennis or racquetball courts for now as the side-to-side movements in these sports put too much stress on the stretching and changing muscles and ligaments of your hips</p>

                    <p>As you baby grows you may have to change how long or hard you can exercise. Your healthcare provider may ask you to track your active heart rate and keep it at low-to moderate-intensity activity. For most pregnant women, your maximum heart rate during exercise shouldn't exceed 110-120 beats/minute (80 percent of your maximum heart rate). Avoid becoming short of breath-you should be able to carry on a conversation during exercise while pregnant.</p>

                	<h2>Signs of Labor</h2>
                	<p>Your body may go through physical changes several days before labor starts. You may notice that the baby has dropped and given you more room for breathing. You may also notice that the baby is now pressing on your bladder, sending you running to the bathroom more often. You may pass a mucus plug that is gloppy in consistency-this plug was in your cervix and protected your baby from infections.</p>
                    <h5>Signs of Labor</h5>
                    <p>It helps to learn the signs and symptoms of labor; you may experience one or any of the following when your labor is preparing to start.</p>
                    <div class="topics-list-grid">
                    	<ul>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>A sudden gush or slow trickle of clear vaginal fluid</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                    <p>Sometimes people have these signs and rush to the hospital only to find out they are not in true labor, and get sent back home to wait more. With false labor, your contractions will be inconsistent and your nurses will notice that your cervix isn't opening or changing.</p>
                    <h5>Get Checked</h5>
                    <p>You should always go to where you'll give birth if you experience any of the following symptoms or changes.</p>
